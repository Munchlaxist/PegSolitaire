# PegSolitaire
This is a hobby project where I want to implement peg solitaire in C++ together with a simple two-dimensional UI.<br/>
My goal is not only to implement the game, but to also extend it with multiple features.
# What is already done?
I have implemented already the basic game logic and a basic UI. You could already play and restart the game if won/lost.<br/>
My main goal was to have a clear seperation of game logic and user interface for easier understandability and readability.
# What are my plans?
There is no fixed release yet. It is my first public project in GitHub, so I have much to learn.</br>
But I plan to have it at some point. For more specific plans like game advancements and documentation you can just check </br>
out the "Issues".<br/>
But it should be clear that I do not see myself as a texture artist, so a simple GUI is absolutely enough for me in the near future.
# What is my intention with this project?
First of all: Programming is fun :-).<br/>
Second of all I always wanted to have a project where I can work on when I'm bored.
# Which library do I use in my project?
I use the SFML (Simple and Fast Multimedia Library) in version 3.0.0 (https://www.sfml-dev.org/download/sfml/3.0.0/)
